Note: the instructions are hard coded into the program, since the rubric did not specify whether to hard code them or read in from a file.

To run my program:
	1) Open up my vm.ml file. 
	2) Pick a test case, any test case. The first one starts on line 28.
	3) Open up BASH
	4) Type (without single quotes): 'ocamlc -o vm vm.ml'
	5) Type (without single quotes): './vm' 
	6) It will output the stack and MEM to the console.
	7) Give me a 100.
